## Techniques

### Text Embeddings

[Back to Top](#contents)

Text embeddings allow deep learning to be effective on smaller datasets. These are often first inputs to a deep learning archiectures and most popular way of transfer learning in NLP. Embeddings are simply vectors or a more generically, real valued representations of strings. Word embeddings are considered a great starting point for most deep NLP tasks. 

The most popular names in word embeddings are word2vec by Google (Mikolov) and GloVe by Stanford (Pennington, Socher and Manning). fastText seems to be a fairly popular for multi-lingual sub-word embeddings. 


#### word2vec
word2vec was introduced by [T. Mikolov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oBu8kMMAAAAJ&hl=en) et al. when he was with Google.

* [Deep Recurrent Generative decoder model for abstractive text summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00625v1.pdf) by Li et al, 2017 uses a sequence-to-sequence oriented encoder-decoder model equipped with a deep recurrent generative decoder.
* [A Semantic Relevance Based Neural Network for Text Summarization and Text Simplification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02318v1.pdf) by Ma and Sun, 2017 uses a gated attention enocder-decoder for text summarization.
* [Beyond Stemming and Lemmatization: Ultra-stemming to Improve Automatic Text Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.3126v1.pdf) by Moreno, 2012 proposes a new method of normalization called ultra-stemming that basically means reducing words to its initial letters.
* [This mini-awesome list](https://github.com/mathsyouth/awesome-text-summarization) provides a wider view of the research papers in text summarization.
* [This blogpost](https://medium.com/@Currie32/text-summarization-with-amazon-reviews-41801c2210b) uses Amazon food reviews for text summarization. the code implementation is [here](https://github.com/Currie32/Text-Summarization-with-Amazon-Reviews).
* [This TextSum model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/textsum) is from the official TensorFlow repository.
* [TextTeaser](https://github.com/DataTeaser/textteaser) is a automatic text summarization algorithm. The algorithm is ported in Python and Scala.
