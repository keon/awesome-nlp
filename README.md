## Techniques

### Text Embeddings

[Back to Top](#contents)

Text embeddings allow deep learning to be effective on smaller datasets. These are often first inputs to a deep learning archiectures and most popular way of transfer learning in NLP. Embeddings are simply vectors or a more generically, real valued representations of strings. Word embeddings are considered a great starting point for most deep NLP tasks. 

The most popular names in word embeddings are word2vec by Google (Mikolov) and GloVe by Stanford (Pennington, Socher and Manning). fastText seems to be a fairly popular for multi-lingual sub-word embeddings. 


#### word2vec
word2vec was introduced by [T. Mikolov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oBu8kMMAAAAJ&hl=en) et al. when he was with Google.
